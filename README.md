# mercury-nano-mode

A simple syntax highlighting scheme for the nano editor to work with the
Mercury programming language.

# Installation

The file should be copied to wherever makes sense for your OS so that nano can
find it. It is based upon the Prolog mode, it isn't perfect but it works well
enough for daily use.

For me on my mac-mini that's:

    ~/.nano/mercury.nanorc


# Error inclusion

This file makes use of a utility I write called pberr, you can find that here:

You will of course nned to buld it and install it as directed.
