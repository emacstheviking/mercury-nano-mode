# mercury-nano-mode

A simple syntax highlighting scheme for the nano editor to work with the
Mercury programming language.

# Installation

The file should be copied to wherever makes sense for your OS so that nano can
find it. It is based upon the Prolog mode, it isn't perfect but it works well
enough for daily use.

For me on my mac-mini that's:

    ~/.nano/mercury.nanorc
